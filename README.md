# Poke Apprentice React Application
  This repository contains my solution to a Coding Challenge. Below, I outline the tasks completed and the decisions made during development.

## Challenge Tasks Completed
  Web Page Input: Implemented a web page where users can enter a Pokémon name.
  Pokémon Query: Upon submission, the application queries the PokéAPI to retrieve details of the specified Pokémon, including its name, number, and sprite. If no match is found, an error message is displayed.
  Navigation Buttons: Added "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate between Pokémon based on their ID numbers.
  Text-based Search: Implemented a text-based search feature where users can input a Pokémon name or partial name to find suggestions of matching Pokémons.
  Automated Tests: Included one automated test for the "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

## Development Decisions
Tech Stack: Chose React for building the frontend due to its flexibility, ease of use, and popularity within Subvisual's tech stack.
Styling: Utilized CSS for styling the components to maintain simplicity and flexibility. No external styling frameworks were used to keep the project lightweight.
State Management: Utilized React's built-in state management for handling user input, Pokémon data, and navigation.
Testing: Chose Jest and React Testing Library for writing tests due to their simplicity and effectiveness in testing React components.
Caching: Implemented a simple caching mechanism using local storage to store previously fetched Pokémon data and reduce unnecessary API calls.
Setup Instructions
